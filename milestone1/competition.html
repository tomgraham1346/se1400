        <h2>Why Lil-Squirty?</h2>
        <h4>A Lil-Squirty NEVER hurty</h4>
        <p>You could hardly fathom how cheap I could charge you, and my competition knows that. Unfortunately, the bad news is that my competition likes cash money. The good news is that I like money a Lil-Less. When the majority of your overhead is cleaning chemicals that can be bought in bulk AND be diluted, you can charge however much you wanna get payed. My competition may have been in business longer with more "experience" SO WHAT. I am using the chemicals that YOU would pick for your car, and Lil-Squirty will be an extension of YOU and the care YOU have for YOUR mean machine. Let me suprise you with how affordable mobile detailing can be by giving me a call at *REDACTED*</p>
